## Question 1: also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?

1. The difference between LinkList and ArrayList is that LinkedList operate 
with nodes and LinkList will run faster.

## Question 2: what happens if you use list.remove(77)?

1. It shouldn't work because with a linked list there has to be iterations in order to check for the data field.
